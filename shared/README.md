# Shared Files

- `look-and-feel` -- contains the canonical versions of the `header-nav` and `footer` files. 
  - These are directly copied into the "Admin > Look and Feel" interfaces in LibGuides and LibCal. 
  - They also are used in header and footer files in: 
    - LibraryH3lp -- both the header and footer templates have supporting CSS and JS code that needs to be preserved.
    - SerSol -- both the header and footer inputs have supporting CSS and JS code that needs to be preserved.
    - Wordpress -- they can be copied verbatim into the `header-include.txt` and footer-include.txt` files.
