# Ask Us By Email

The Library has an email form at: http://resources.library.lemoyne.edu/askus/by-email

We were using a JotForm for web-based email submissions but LibraryH3lp's spam filter began flagging those emails pretty consistently after over a year of no problems. The two biggest contributors to the spam score were 1) HTML-only (no text version) and 2) the From field is base-64 encoded. Although there was a possible remediation to the JotForm, at least [with regard to the second point](https://www.jotform.com/answers/266094-Notification-e-mails-getting-blocked-Base64-encoding-on-a-From-field-), we didn't have a paid account, so it ultimately didn't seem feasible.

LibraryH3lp now offers access to its own mail server and has documentation for coding the forms: https://docs.libraryh3lp.com/3mail-forms

They also coded up an example for us that works: https://chatstaff.us/testbed/lemoyne-email-form.html
