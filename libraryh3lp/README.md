# LibraryH3lp Files

- `templates` -- LibraryH3lp provides 15 template files for styling the FAQ site. Documented here are several versions of the site:
  - `default` -- LibraryH3lp is, be default, built around Bootstrap 2.
  - `legacy-files` -- these are the template files that LibraryH3lp staff created in 2015, albeit with some later modifications made before we went live.
  - `bootstrap_v1` -- version of the site that updated the legacy files to Bootstrap 3 and applied the new design elements. It used the overall layout structure that LibraryH3lp created. 
  - `bootstrap_v2` -- modification of the `bootstrap_v1` site to integrate with the AskUs service pages in LibGuides.
