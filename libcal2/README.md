# LibCal v2 Files

Code here is for system files and content boxes for essential guides on the site.

- `homepage` directory -- code for boxes on room bookings homepage.
- `look-and-feel` -- only the `js-css-code.txt` file is unique. `header.txt` and `footer.txt` files are now moved to the `shared/look-and-feel` folder and act as masters. 
- `settings` -- code for LibCal Google Analytics.
- `spaces` -- text for the descriptions that display for each of the room booking pages in LibCal.
