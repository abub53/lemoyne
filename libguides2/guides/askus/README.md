# Ask Us! Reference Services

The main feature of this guide is its integration with the LibraryH3lp FAQs through the sidebar navigation. It also features Font Awesome icons in the navigation to suggest the buttons that were previously featured. 

## Custom Footer

Because the AskUs sidebar widget is redundant on this page, code for it was omitted from the footer. This is possible by assigning the guide to a LibGuides group that uses a custom footer. See `shared/look-and-feel/footer.txt` but remove the following lines:

```
<!-- AskUs Widget (LibraryH3lp) -->
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="http://lemoynelibrary.org/libraryh3lp/css/lemoyne-chat-sidebar.css"/>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://lemoynelibrary.org/libraryh3lp/js/supports-flexbox.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://lemoynelibrary.org/libraryh3lp/js/lemoyne-chat-sidebar.js"></script>
```
