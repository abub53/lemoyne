<!-- Update: 2020-03-18 -->

<h4>Changes to my schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic</h4>

<p>
The Le Moyne College campus and the Falcone Library building are closed for the remainder of the 2020 Spring semester. Librarians are working remotely, but continue to offer research and reference assistance and are available to provide instruction.</p>

<p>We are available by online appointment, meeting using Zoom Meeting, Google Hangouts, phone, or another system of your choosing. You can also reach me through the library&#39;s <a href="https://resources.library.lemoyne.edu/askus/by-chat">chat service</a> during my on-call hours, posted below.</p>

<p><strong>Zoom Meetings</strong>: My Zoom Meeting room is <a href="https://lemoyne.zoom.us/my/tomkeays" target="_blank">https://lemoyne.zoom.us/my/tomkeays</a>. This is the most full-featured option and includes options for screen-sharing, whiteboards, video, audio, and chat.</p>

<p><strong>Google Hangouts</strong>: These can be initiated through Gmail or by visiting <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">hangouts.google.com</a>. If you are using your Le Moyne College account, you will be able to search and find me by my name (&quot;Keays&quot;) or email address (&quot;keaysht@lemoyne.edu&quot;). If I'm not online, I will receive a message that I will respond to the next time I sign in.</p>
