# Serials Solutions Files

Serials Solutions provides a branding area that lets you define the header and footer as well as assiging a single stylesheet that guarantees that it loads early in page load.

- `legacy-files` -- files from the pre-Bootstrap version of the Journal Finder. Most of the files were actually hosted at RackCDN.
- `bootstrap` -- both the `header-nav` and `footer` files need to updated from the files from the `shared/look-and-feel` directory. They contain other supporting code for calling JS and CSS files needed by the site.
